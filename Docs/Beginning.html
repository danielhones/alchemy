<h1>Beginning Tutorial</h1>
<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>The method we will use in this program is known as functional ear training.  The goal is to learn to hear the function of a note in the 
context of a key. This differs from the traditional method whose goal is to learn to hear melodic and harmonic intervals in isolation.  
The program works by playing a cadence and then playing a random note (or multiple notes simultaneously).  Then you will try to identify 
the note that was played as it relates to the key.  That seems like a daunting task at first but we can ease into by taking advantage of the 
features of the program.
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>The program allows you to set preferences that determine which notes it will choose at random.  To access the preferences, start the program 
and click on its title in the menu bar at the top of your screen and click on "Preferences".  This opens a window that will allow you to change 
the preferences.  To get started, let's limit the program to playing just two notes - Do and Mi.  Click on all the notes that aren't Do and Mi 
and you will see that they become deselected.  Now click the "Save Preferences" button and close the window.  
<p>In the main window, click "Start".  The program will play a cadence, followed by a note that will be either Do or Mi.  If you're not sure 
which note was played, just guess - you have a 50% chance of getting it right. The program will tell you if it was right by highlighting the 
note name in green and playing the next question.  If your answer was wrong, it will be highlighted in red and you must select the right note 
before it continues.  Practice with this until you can accurately hear the difference between Do and Mi with close to 100% accuracy.  
When you feel you're ready to advance, go back to the preferences window and select some more notes.  I recommend adding Sol first, so now the 
program will choose from the notes of the tonic triad - Do, Mi, and Sol.  Practice with these until you feel confident adding new notes, and 
continue adding new notes until you can accurately identify any note.
<h3>The buttons</h3>
<p>The "Check answer" button checks the notes you've selected and highlights correct notes with green and incorrect notes with red.  It doesn't 
play the next question until you've determined all the correct notes.  If you're ripping your hair out because you just can't figure out what 
the notes are, you can click the "Next question" button which will reveal the right answer to you by highlighting the correct notes with yellow, 
and move on to the next question.  "Repeat question" will repeat the entire question - cadence and then the notes. "Repeat notes" will play 
the notes again.  To make the program easier and faster to use, there are keyboard shortcuts for all the buttons that you might want to use:
<div style="margin-left:50px" style="text-align:left"><pre>
"Check Answer"    = spacebar
"Next question"   = delete
"Repeat question" = C
"Repeat notes"    = V
</pre></div>
