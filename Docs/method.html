<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> What is ear training?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>   Ear training is the process of learning to identify the sounds you hear in music.  As you might imagine,
   this is a broad definition and ear training itself covers many topics within it.  For example, you can practice
   ear training to learn the sounds of individual chords, or to identify rhythms, or to recognize instruments
   by their timbre.  The particular method of ear training we will use with this program is called "functional ear
   training."  That's the process of learning to identify a note by its function within a key.  If that doesn't
   make sense to you right now, don't worry because we will cover everything you need to know in the upcoming sections.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Why is it important?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>   So now that you know what ear training is (if you didn't already), you would certainly be justified in asking,
   "Okay, so what?  I play pretty well, I have a decent ear, why do I need to ear train?"  The answer is, of course,
   that you don't <i>need</i> to ear train.  You don't <i>need</i> to eat healthy either, but it's a probably a good idea to
   try.  
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Perfect pitch</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>   Perfect pitch (or absolute pitch) is the ability to hear a note or notes and know instantly what pitches they
   are, without having to hear a reference pitch.  So far, all respectable research has concluded that a person has
   to be born with perfect pitch (or develop it by age 4?)  and it cannot be developed over time with training
   (((need citation))).  I don't have perfect pitch, and if you're reading this then you don't have perfect pitch
   either.  That's nothing to be ashamed of.  Only 1 in 10,000 people have the ability
   (((<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200607/the-mysteries-perfect-pitch">http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200607/the-mysteries-perfect-pitch</a>))).  The only thing the rest of us
   can do is cry and come up with reasons why we're glad we aren't cursed with such an affliction.  And of course,
   we can ear train.
</p>
<p>
   While having perfect pitch would be very cool, probably the closest most of us can get is having very strong
   relative (or functional pitch).  We won't be able to tell precisely what notes we hear without a reference pitch
   to compare them to, but we can develop the ability to tell what notes we hear within the context of a key.
   More on that in a few sections.

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Reading music</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p>   Despite the fact that regimented ear training often exists solely in the realm of music college classes, you do
   not need to be able to read music in order to ear train.  In fact, I've written this program and this document
   specifically to avoid written music.  This is simply because I believe in the value of ear training and I don't
   want to scare anybody off from the idea just because they don't read music.  There are many great musicians who
   can't read music and there are many great musicians who are excellent readers.  Personally, I can read music and
   I think that anyone who's serious about being a musician should learn to read.  But my goal here is not to
   proselytize so I'll leave it at that and we can move on.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> How this method is different</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">

<p>   The traditional approach to ear training consists of learning the sounds of the intervals between individual
   notes.  These are usually learned outside of the context of the key.  One problem with this approach is that
   when it is time to hear the intervals in the context of a key (as they would be in real music), it can be
   difficult to tell which notes in the key are actually forming the interval.  If you take the interval of a major
   third for example, there are three different major thirds that occur in the major scale.  Each of them sound
   markedly different in context because they are formed from notes that have different sounds within the key.
</p>
<p>   
   The way this method teaches ear training, we learn the sounds of the individual notes first, so that problem
   never comes up.  Learning which notes within a scale make up a major third then becomes a matter of learning
   music theory, rather than being the objective of ear training.  Of course, as with most things in life, it's
   probably beneficial to try using both approaches.

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Overview</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>   This section will cover the just the basic knowledge you need in order to start using this method of ear
   training.  That includes learning about half steps and whole steps, the major scale, and the names of the notes
   within the major scale.  If you are confident in your knowledge of basic music theory you can probably skip this
   section.  If there is anything unfamiliar to you in the rest of this document, refer back to this section to
   review.

<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Pitches and notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>   Most (probably all) of the music you've ever listened to is made of only 12 different notes.  These notes are
   also called pitches.  Some pitches are higher than others.  Here's what those pitches sound like, played from a
   lower pitch to a higher one (((sound example here))).  You can think of those pitches as being stacked on top of
   each other.  When we run out of those 12 pitches, we stack the pattern on top of itself again.  Here's the sound
   clip from before, with another 12 pitches played afterwards, all continuously rising in pitch (((another sound
   example))).  So when the pattern of 12 pitches repeats, we get another set of the same "kind" of note, but it
   sounds higher.  This is called an octave.  Notes that are an octave apart sound like higher or lower versions of
   the same note.  Here's an example of three notes that are each an octave apart, starting with the lower note
   (((another sound example here))).  
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> Whole steps and half steps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">

<p>    The smallest interval that exists in Western (I don't mean country and western) music is the half step.  The
    next smallest interval is a whole step.  Two half steps, as you would hope, do in fact make one whole step.  On
    certain instruments, it's possible to play pitches that are in between the 12 pitches we are used to hearing.
    In this case, there are intervals smaller than a half step.  For our purposes, we don't need to be concerned
    with hearing pitches that are in between the 12 we know because they usually end up just sounding out of tune.
    If you decide later on that you want to develop your ear for intonation or microtones (as the in between pitches
    are called), you can find other methods and tools to practice that.  In this program, all notes are in tune.

<div id="outline-container-2-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2</span> The piano keyboard</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">

<p>    Most people have seen a piano keyboard.  If you haven't it looks like this:  (((Picture of piano keyboard)))
</p>
<p>
    A full-size piano has 88 keys and each key plays a different pitch.  While that sounds overwhelming at first, we
    know that there are actually only 12 different notes in Western music.  And if you look closer at the piano, you
    can see that huge mess of white and black keys is just a pattern that repeats: (((Picture of one octave of
    keyboard C to B))).  In that pattern, there are 7 white keys and 5 black keys.  The white keys (if you start at
    the leftmost key) play what's called a major scale.  It sounds like this (((Sound clip of a C major scale))).
    A major scale is just a pattern of whole steps and half steps.  Every major scale is built from the same
    pattern, although they start on pitches.  Given 12 different pitches, there are 12 different major scales in
    Western music.  <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup>

<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> What is a key?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">

<p>   A key is what sounds like the resolution point or "home base" of a piece of music.  You could also think of it as
   providing a context for the notes you hear in a piece of music.  Notes that are in the key have a particular
   sound and notes that are outside the key have a different sound.

<div id="outline-container-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Solfege vs scale degrees</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">

<p>   In addition to scale degrees, there is another way to name the notes in a key (and even more beyond that but we
   won't worry about that).  It's called solfege, with a fancy accent over the first 'e' like this: solfège.  It
   also goes by the names solfeggio and sol-fa.  In my experience, solfège is the more common name, but to save me
   from having to remember how to type the accent, I'm going to call it solfege from here on out.  Solfege uses
   pronounceable syllables to name the notes instead of numbers.  It's very likely that you've already heard solfege
   syllables.  The song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIjobdArtiA">"Do Re Mi Fa"</a> from the "Sound of Music" is a famous example of using solfege syllables to
   sing the notes of a major scale.
</p>
<p>
   Before explaining what the syllables are and how they relate to the scale degrees we already know, let's take a
   moment to answer the question you probably have - "Why on Earth are there TWO different ways to name the notes in
   a major scale?  Is it to torture students and inexperienced musicians who don't know their theory?"  It's not
   there to torture you, although it might have that effect.  The main benefit of solfege is that it's easy to sing
   the syllables.  If you imagine Julie Andrews singing that song using scale degrees rather than solfege, it
   wouldn't be nearly as memorable; it would just be counting.
</p>
<p>
   For the purposes of this ear training method, you can decide whether you prefer scale degrees or solfege to name
   the notes, and just use that.  There's an option for each one in the program.  Here's how the solfege syllables
   relate to the notes in a major scale:

</tbody>
</table>


<p>
   Now for the pronunciation - "do" is pronounced like "dough", "re" is pronounced like "ray" (a drop of golden
   sun), and "mi" and "ti" sound like "me" and "tea" respectively.  This covers the diatonic notes in the major
   scale.  What about the in between notes?  In solfege, when a note is flatted, you take the first letter of the
   note and add "e" (sounds like "ay") as the vowel after it.  For example, ♭3 is "me" ("may") and ♭6 is "le"
   ("lay").  We need to make an exception for ♭2 and we call it "ra", as in "ra ra sis boom ba."  To alter the
   syllables for sharp notes, we take the first letter of the syllable and change the vowel sound to "i" ("ee").
   For example, ♯4 becomes "fi" and ♯6 becomes "li."  Therefore, just as ♯2 is the same note as ♭3, "ri" is the same
   note as "me."  They're enharmonic.  
</p>
<p>
   Here are the syllables formatted as diatonic and nondiatonic in both major and minor keys.  Just like we did with
   scale degrees, we'll only use the flat names for chromatic notes, to make it look a little cleaner and because
   our goal here isn't to be pedantic, but to have a working knowledge of the basics.  Of course, if you want to
   have a solid grasp of solfege, you should work on also using the enharmonic names.

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> The cadence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>   A cadence is a sequence of chords that often occurs at the end of a phrase or section of a piece of music.  When
   it is used to conclude a piece of music, it usually has a sound of finality that clearly defines the key of the
   composition (for more about cadences, see this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_(music)">Wikipedia page</a>).  Here's an example of a cadence.  The first and
   last chords played are the tonic chord (or "home base") of the key: ((( Figure out how to play audio )))
</p>
<p>
   In this method of ear training, we'll play a sequence consisting of four chords to establish the sound of the
   key.  Then, we'll play one or more random notes simultaneously and learn to identify the sound of each note in
   that particular key.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Identifying the notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>   At first, trying to identify a note by listening for its function in a key is a daunting task.  How on Earth can
   you hear a cadence, then a note, and then just pluck out its name from thin air?  As with everything else, we
   start simply and progress in small increments.  The example below plays a cadence, and then plays Do (or scale
   degree 1) in the key:   ((( another sound example )))
</p>
<p>
   Play it several times and pay close attention to the way Do sounds.  To me it sounds stable and resolved, and
   truth be told, it sounds rather plain and uninteresting.  What does it sound like to you?  All the other notes
   sound less stable than Do. Often, it feels like your ear wants to hear them resolve to Do.  Listen to this next
   example, which plays the cadence followed by the note Re: ((( another sound example here )))
</p>
<p>
   To me, Re sounds like it has a healthy desire to move down a whole step to Do.  While it doesn't sound totally
   unstable or dissonant, there is a bit of tension there.  Go back and play the previous two samples several times
   and pay close attention to the difference in the way Do and Re sound.  Soon you will hear the difference between
   them as clearly as you can see the difference between orange and purple.

<p>   Now that you can identify Do and Re, it's time to start adding other notes.  That is the real benefit of using
   this program to practice this method of ear training.  You can customize which notes the program will choose from
   to play after the cadence, allowing you to progress in small easy increments or isolate notes that you have
   trouble with.
