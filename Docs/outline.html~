<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> What is ear training?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>   Ear training is the process of learning to identify mentally the sounds you hear in music.  As you might imagine,
   this is a broad definition and ear training itself covers many topics within it.  For example, you can practice
   ear training to learn the sounds of individual chords, or to identify rhythms by ear, or to recognize instruments
   by their sound.  The particular method of ear training we will use with this program is called "functional ear
   training."  That's the process of learning to identify a note by its function within a key.  If that doesn't
   make sense to you right now, don't worry because we will cover everything you need to know in the upcoming sections.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Why is it important?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>   So now that you know what ear training is (if you didn't already), you would certainly be justified in asking,
   "Okay, so what?  I play pretty well, I have a decent ear, why do I need to ear train?"  The answer is, of course,
   that you don't <i>need</i> to ear train.  You don't <i>need</i> to eat healthy either, but it's a probably a good idea to
   try.  I'll talk about a few reasons why, even though you don't need to ear train to be a musician, you might
   personally want to ear train in order to become a better musician.  
</p>
<p>   
   I think that if most musicians were asked, "wouldn't it be nice to be able to hear some music and know exactly
   what notes are being played without having to use your instrument as a reference?," they would all answer yes
   emphatically.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Perfect pitch</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>   Perfect pitch (or absolute pitch) is the ability to hear a note or notes and know instantly what pitches they
   are, without having to hear a reference pitch.  So far, all respectable research has concluded that a person has
   to be born with perfect pitch (or develop it by age 4?)  and it cannot be developed over time with training
   (((need citation))).  I don't have perfect pitch, and if you're reading this then you don't have perfect pitch
   either.  That's nothing to be ashamed of.  Only 1 in 10,000 people have the ability
   (((<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200607/the-mysteries-perfect-pitch">http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200607/the-mysteries-perfect-pitch</a>))).  The only thing the rest of us
   can do is cry and come up with reasons why we're glad we aren't cursed with such an affliction.  And of course,
   we can ear train.
</p>
<p>
   While having perfect pitch would be very cool, probably the closest most of us can get is having very strong
   relative (or functional pitch).  We won't be able to tell precisely what notes we hear without a reference pitch
   to compare them to, but we can develop the ability to tell what notes they are within the context of a key.
   More on that in a few sections.

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Reading music</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p>   Despite the fact that ear training is often solely in the realm of music college classes, you do not need to be
   able to read music in order to ear train.  In fact, I've written this program and this document specifically to
   avoid written music.  The reason for this is simply that I believe in the value of ear training and I don't want
   to scare anybody off from the idea just because they don't read music.  There are many great musicians who can't
   read music and there are many great musicians who are great readers.  Personally, I can read music and I think
   that anyone who's serious about learning music should learn to read.
</p>
<p>
   Contrary to what a lot of "cool blues guys" and "cool rock guys" say, learning to read music will not ruin your
   ear or your ability to be creative or stay true to your music, or whatever.  My hunch is that people who spout
   off those reasons for not learning to read are either too scared or too lazy to learn.  I'll leave it to someone
   else to convince them to learn to read and write music.  Fortunately for them, they can still use this program
   to ear train.

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Overview</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>   This section will cover the just the basic knowledge you need in order to start using this method of ear
   training.  That includes the half steps and whole steps, the major scale, and the names of the notes within the
   major scale.  If you are confident in your knowledge of basic music theory you can probably skip this section.
   If there is anything unfamiliar to you in the rest of this document, refer back to this section to review.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> Whole steps and half steps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">

<p>    The smallest interval that exists in Western (I don't mean country and western) music is the half step.  The
    next smallest interval is a whole step.  Two half steps, as you would expect and hope, do in fact make one whole
    step.  On certain instruments, it's possible to play pitches that are in between the 12 pitches we are used to
    hearing.  In this case, there are intervals smaller than a half step.  For our purposes, we don't need to be
    concerned with hearing pitches that are in between the 12 we know because they usually end up just sounding out
    of tune.  If you decide later on that you want to develop your ear for intonation or microtones (as the in
    between pitches are called), you can find other methods and tools to practice that.  In this program, everything
    is in tune.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2</span> The piano keyboard</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">

<p>    Most people have seen a piano keyboard.  If you haven't it looks like this:  (((Picture of piano keyboard)))
</p>
<p>
    A full-size piano has 88 keys and each plays a different pitch.  While that sounds overwhelming at first, we
    know that there are actually only 12 different notes in Western music.  And if you look closer at the piano, you
    can see that huge mess of white and black keys is actually just a pattern that repeats: (((Picture of one octave
    of keyboard C to B))).  In that pattern, there are 7 white keys and 5 black keys.  The white keys (if you start
    at the leftmost key) play what's called a major scale.  (((Sound clip of a C major scale))).
