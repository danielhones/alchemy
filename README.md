# Alchemy
An ear training app for OS X that implements the Charlie Banacos-style ear training exercise for single and multiple
simultaneous notes.

To build it, download the zip file or clone it with git: `git clone git@github.com:danielhones/alchemy.git`.  Then open
the XCode project, select Run, and cross your fingers.

The documentation includes a brief primer on basic music theory and how the exercise works, as well as some pages on
using the program.  The documentation is not complete yet, but hopefully the program is intuitive enough to use without
a manual.  There are several resources online explaining the ear training exercise itself.
