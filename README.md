An ear training app for OS X that implements the Charlie Banacos-style ear training exercise for single and multiple simultaneous notes.

To build it, open it up in XCode, select Run, and cross your fingers.  I plan on releasing the app for free soon on the App Store.

The documentation includes a brief primer on basic music theory and how the exercise works, as well as some pages on using the program.  The documentation is not complete yet, but hopefully the program is intuitive enough to use without a manual.  There are several resources online explaining the ear training exercise itself.
