# What is it?
Alchemy is an ear training program for Mac OS X.  It's absolutely free and without ads.  It's open source.  It might
even be useful.

It will be available for download very soon from this site and the Mac App Store.  If you're brave, you can build it now
from the [source code](http://www.github.com/danielhones/alchemy).

# Documentation
The documentation is a work in progress, so some parts are disorganized and incomplete.

* [Learning the method](method.html)
* [Using the program](manual.html)
