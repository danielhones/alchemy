# What is it?
Alchemy is a program for practicing functional ear training on Mac OS X.  It's absolutely free and without ads.  It's
open source.  It might even be useful.

It will be available for download very soon from this site and the Mac App Store.  If you're adventurous, you can build
it now from the [source code](http://www.github.com/danielhones/alchemy).
