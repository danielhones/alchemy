# Alchemy Ear Training:<br>Learning the method

# Introduction
## What is ear training?
Ear training is the process of learning to identify the sounds you hear in music.  As you might imagine,
this is a broad definition and ear training itself covers many topics within it.  For example, you can practice
ear training to learn the sounds of individual chords, or to identify rhythms, or to recognize instruments
by their timbre.  The particular method of ear training we will use with this program is called "functional ear
training."  That's the process of learning to identify a note by its function within a key.  If that doesn't
make sense to you right now, don't worry because we will cover everything you need to know in the upcoming sections.
   
## Why is it important?
Now that you know what ear training is (if you didn't already), you would certainly be justified in asking,
"Okay, so what?  I play pretty well, I have a decent ear, why do I need to ear train?"  The answer is, of course,
that you don't /need/ to ear train.  You don't /need/ to eat healthy either, but it's a probably a good idea to
try.

## Perfect pitch
Perfect pitch (or absolute pitch) is the ability to hear a note or notes and know instantly what pitches they are,
without having to hear a reference pitch.  So far, all respectable research has concluded that a person has to be born
with perfect pitch or develop it by age 4 and it cannot be developed over time with
training<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch#Nature_vs._nurture)</sup>.  I don't have perfect pitch,
and if you're reading this then you probably don't have it either.  That's nothing to be ashamed of.  Only 1 in 10,000
people have the ability<sup>[2](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/268/5211/621.1)</sup>.  The
only thing the rest of us can do is cry and come up with reasons why we're glad we aren't cursed with such an
affliction.

While having perfect pitch would be very cool, the closest most of us can get is having very strong relative (or
functional pitch).  We won't be able to tell precisely what notes we hear without a reference pitch to compare them to,
but we can develop the ability to tell what notes we hear within the context of a key.  More on that in a few sections.
   
## Reading music
Despite the fact that regimented ear training often exists solely in the realm of music college classes, you do
not need to be able to read music in order to ear train.  In fact, I've written this program and this document
specifically to avoid written music.  This is simply because I believe in the value of ear training and I don't
want to scare anybody off from the idea just because they don't read music.  There are many great musicians who
can't read music and there are many great musicians who are excellent readers.  Personally, I think that anyone who's
serious about being a musician should learn to read, but my goal here is not to proselytize so I'll leave it at that
and we can move on.
   
## How this method is different
The traditional approach to ear training consists of learning the sounds of the intervals between individual
notes.  These are usually learned outside of the context of the key.  One problem with this approach is that
when it is time to hear the intervals in the context of a key (as they would be in real music), it can be
difficult to tell which notes in the key are actually forming the interval.  If you take the interval of a major
third for example, there are three different major thirds that occur in the major scale.  Each of them sound
markedly different in context because they are formed from notes that have different sounds within the key.
   
The way this method teaches ear training, we learn the sounds of the individual notes first, so that problem
never comes up.  Learning which notes within a scale make up a major third then becomes a matter of learning
music theory, rather than being the objective of ear training.  Of course, as with most things in life, it's
probably beneficial to try using both approaches.


# Basics
## Overview
This section will cover the just the basic knowledge you need in order to start using this method of ear
training.  That includes learning about half steps and whole steps, the major scale, and the names of the notes
within the major scale.  If you are confident in your knowledge of basic music theory you can probably skip this
section.  If there is anything unfamiliar to you in the rest of this document, refer back to this section to
review.
   
## Pitches and notes
Most (probably all) of the music you've ever listened to is made of only 12 different notes.  These notes are
also called pitches.  Some pitches are higher than others.  Here's what those 12 pitches sound like ascending:

</center>

You can think of those pitches as being stacked on top of each other.  When we run out of those 12 pitches, we stack the
pattern on top of itself again.  So when the pattern of 12 pitches repeats, we get another set of the same "kind" of
note, but it sounds higher.  This is called an octave.  Notes that are an octave apart sound like higher or lower
versions of the same note.  Here's an example of three notes that are each an octave apart, starting with the lower note

**Whole steps and half steps**<br>
The smallest interval that exists in Western (I don't mean country and western) music is the half step.  The next
smallest interval is a whole step.  Two half steps, as you would hope, make one whole step.  On certain instruments,
it's possible to play pitches that are in between the 12 pitches we are used to hearing.  In this case, there are
intervals smaller than a half step.  For our purposes, we don't need to be concerned with hearing pitches that are in
between the 12 we know because they usually end up just sounding out of tune.  If you decide later on that you want to
develop your ear for intonation or microtones (as the in between pitches are called), you can find other methods and
tools to practice that.  In this program, all notes are in tune.

**The piano keyboard**<br>

A full-size piano has 88 keys and each key plays a different pitch.  While that sounds overwhelming at first, we
know that there are actually only 12 different notes in Western music.  And if you look closer at the piano, you
can see that huge mess of white and black keys is just a pattern that repeats: (((Picture of one octave of
keyboard C to B))).  In that pattern, there are 7 white keys and 5 black keys.  The white keys (if you start at
the leftmost key) play what's called a major scale.  It sounds like this:

A major scale is just a pattern of whole steps and half steps.  Every major scale is built from the same
pattern, although they start on pitches.  Given 12 different pitches, there are 12 different major scales in
Western music.  [fn:: Due to the fact that some notes have two different names, there actually 15 different major
scales when writing out the scales on paper.  But 3 of those scales are redundant and since we're not concerned
with naming actual pitches here, we will just take it as a fact that there are 12 different major scales, one
starting on each of the 12 pitches.]
    
## What is a key?
A key is what sounds like the resolution point or "home base" of a piece of music.  You could also think of it as
providing a context for the notes you hear in a piece of music.  Notes that are in the key have a particular
sound and notes that are outside the key have a different sound.

## Solf&#xe8;ge vs scale degrees
In addition to scale degrees, there is another way to name the notes in a key (and even more beyond that but we won't
worry about that).  It's called solfege, with a fancy accent over the first 'e' like this: solf&#xe8;ge.  To save me from
having to remember how to type the accent, I'm going to call it solfege from here on out.  Solfege uses pronounceable
syllables to name the notes instead of numbers.  It's very likely that you've already heard solfege syllables.  The song
["Do Re Mi Fa"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dpGmAc3kMk) from the "Sound of Music" is a famous example of solfege.

Before explaining what the syllables are and how they relate to the scale degrees we already know, let's take a
moment to answer a question you might have - "Why on Earth are there TWO different ways to name the notes in
a major scale?  Is it to torture students and inexperienced musicians who don't know their theory?"  It's not
there to torture you, although it might have that effect.  The main benefit of solfege is that the note names are are
easy to sing and each is only one syllable long (not like "seven" or "flat three").  If you imagine Julie Andrews
singing that song using scale degrees rather than solfege, it wouldn't be nearly as memorable.

For the purposes of this ear training method, you can decide whether you prefer scale degrees or solfege to name
the notes, and just use that.  There's an option for each one in the program.  Here's how the solfege syllables
relate to the notes in a major scale:

|----------------|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|
**Scale degree** |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |   5 |  6 |  7 |
**Solfege**      | Do | Re | Mi | Fa | Sol | La | Ti |

Now for the pronunciation - "do" is pronounced like "dough", "re" is pronounced like "ray" (a drop of golden sun), and
"mi" and "ti" sound like "me" and "tea" respectively.  This covers the diatonic notes in the major scale.  What about
the in between notes?  In solfege, when a note is flatted, you take the first letter of the note and add "e" (sounds
like "ay") as the vowel after it.  For example, &#x266d;3 is "me" ("may") and &#x266d;6 is "le" ("lay").  We need to
make an exception for &#x266d;2 and we call it "ra", as in "ra ra sis boom ba."  To alter the syllables for sharp notes,
we take the first letter of the syllable and change the vowel sound to "i" ("ee").  For example, &#x266f;4 becomes "fi"
and &#x266f;6 becomes "li."  Therefore, just as &#x266f;2 is the same note as &#x266d;3, "ri" is the same note as "me."
They're enharmonic.

Here are the syllables formatted as diatonic and nondiatonic in both major and minor keys.  Just like we did with
scale degrees, we'll only use the flat names for chromatic notes, to make it look a little cleaner and because
our goal here isn't to be pedantic, but to have a working knowledge of the basics.  Of course, if you want to
have a solid grasp of solfege, you should work on also using the enharmonic names.


[**Major scale**]
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|
Non-diatonic |    | Ra |    | Me |    |    | Se |     | Le |    | Te |    |
Diatonic     | Do |    | Re |    | Mi | Fa |    | Sol |    | La |    | Ti |

[**Minor scale**]
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|
Non-diatonic |    | Ra |    |    | Mi |    | Se |     |    | La |    | Ti |
Diatonic     | Do |    | Re | Me |    | Fa |    | Sol | Le |    | Te |    |
   

# How the method works
## The cadence
A cadence is a sequence of chords that often occurs at the end of a phrase or section of a piece of music.  When it is
used to conclude a piece of music, it usually has a sound of finality that clearly defines the key of the composition
(for more about cadences, see this [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_(music)).  Here's an example
of a major cadence.  The first and last chords played are the tonic chord (or "home base") of the key:

<audio controls id="major-cadence-example">
  <source src="audio/major_cadence_example.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

And this is a cadence in a minor key:

<center>
<audio controls id="minor-cadence-example">
  <source src="audio/minor_cadence_example.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

In this method of ear training, we'll play a sequence consisting of four chords to establish the sound of the key.
Then, we'll play one or more random notes simultaneously and learn to identify the sound of each note in that particular
key.
   
## Identifying the notes
At first, trying to identify a note by listening for its function in a key is a daunting task.  How on Earth can you
hear a cadence, then a note, and then just pluck out its name from thin air?  As with everything else, we start simply
and progress in small increments.  The example below plays a cadence, and then plays Do (or scale degree 1) in the key:

<center>
<audio controls id="cadence-and-do-example">
  <source src="audio/cadence_and_do.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

Play it several times and pay close attention to the way Do sounds.  To me it sounds stable and resolved, and truth be
told, it sounds rather plain and uninteresting.  What does it sound like to you?  All the other notes sound less stable
than Do. Often, it feels like your ear wants to hear them resolve to Do.  Listen to this next example, which plays the
cadence followed by the note Re:

<center>
<audio controls id="cadence-and-re-example">
  <source src="audio/cadence_and_re.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

To me, Re sounds like it has a healthy desire to move down a whole step to Do.  While it doesn't sound totally unstable
or dissonant, there is a bit of tension there.  Go back and play the previous two samples several times and pay close
attention to the difference in the way Do and Re sound.  Soon you will hear the difference between them as clearly as
you can see the difference between orange and purple.

## Baby steps
Now that you can identify Do and Re, it's time to start adding other notes.  That is the real benefit of using this
program to practice this method of ear training.  You can customize which notes the program will choose from to play
after the cadence, allowing you to progress in small easy increments or isolate notes that you have trouble with.
