<h2 id="whatiseartraining">What is ear training?</h2>

<p>Ear training is the process of learning to identify the sounds you hear in music. Admittedly, this is a broad
definition and ear training itself covers many topics within it. For example, you can practice ear training to learn
the sounds of individual chords, or to identify rhythms, or to recognize instruments by their sound. The particular
method of ear training we will use with this program is called &#8220;functional ear training.&#8221; That&#8217;s the process of
learning to identify a note by its function within a key. Don&#8217;t worry if that doesn&#8217;t make any sense right now,
we will cover everything you need to know in the upcoming sections.</p>

<!--
## Why is it important?
-->

<h2 id="perfectpitch">Perfect pitch</h2>

<p>Perfect pitch (or absolute pitch) is the ability to hear a note or notes and know instantly what pitches they are,
without having to hear a reference pitch. So far, all respectable research has concluded that a person has to be born
with perfect pitch or develop it by age 4 and it cannot be developed over time with
training.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> I don&#8217;t have perfect pitch,
and if you&#8217;re reading this then you probably don&#8217;t have it either. That&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of. Only 1 in 10,000
people have the ability.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> The
only thing the rest of us can do is cry and come up with reasons why we&#8217;re glad we aren&#8217;t cursed with such an
affliction.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can still develop our ears without having perfect pitch. While we won&#8217;t be able to tell precisely what
notes we hear without a reference pitch to compare them to, we can develop the ability to tell what notes we hear within
the context of a key.</p>

<h2 id="readingmusic">Reading music</h2>

<p>Despite the fact that regimented ear training often exists solely in the realm of music college classes, you do not need
to be able to read music in order to ear train. I&#8217;ve written this program and this document specifically to avoid
written music. This is simply because I believe in the value of ear training and I don&#8217;t want to scare anybody off from
the idea because they don&#8217;t read music. There are many great musicians who can&#8217;t read music and there are many great
musicians who are excellent readers. Personally, I think that anyone who&#8217;s serious about being a musician should learn
to read, but my goal here is not to proselytize so I&#8217;ll leave it at that and we can move on.</p>

<h2 id="howthismethodisdifferent">How this method is different</h2>

<p>The traditional approach to ear training consists of learning the sounds of the intervals between individual
notes. These are usually learned outside of the context of the key. One problem with this approach is that
when it is time to hear the intervals in the context of a key (as they would be in real music), it can be
difficult to tell which notes in the key are actually forming the interval. If you take the interval of a major
third for example, there are three different major thirds that occur in the major scale. Each of them sound
different in context because they are formed from notes that have different sounds within the key.</p>

<p>The way this method teaches ear training, we learn the sounds of the individual notes first, so that problem never comes
up. Learning which notes within a scale make up a major third then becomes a matter of learning music theory, rather
than being the objective of ear training. Of course, it&#8217;s probably beneficial to try using both approaches.</p>

<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This section will cover the just the basic knowledge you need in order to start using this method of ear
training. That includes learning about half steps and whole steps, the major scale, and the names of the notes
within the major scale. If you are confident in your knowledge of basic music theory you can probably skip this
section.</p>

<h2 id="pitchesandnotes">Pitches and notes</h2>

<p>Most (probably all) of the music you&#8217;ve ever listened to is made of only 12 different notes. These notes are also
called pitches. Here&#8217;s what those 12 pitches sound like ascending:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="chromatic-scale-example">
  <source src="audio/chromatic_scale.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

<p>You can think of those pitches as being stacked on top of each other. When we run out of those 12 pitches, we stack the
pattern on top of itself again. When the pattern repeats, we get the same notes again, but a higher &#8220;version&#8221; of them.
The distance between one version of a note and the next higher or lower version of it is called an octave. Here&#8217;s an
example of four notes that are each an octave apart, starting with the lowest note:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="octave-example">
  <source src="audio/three_octaves.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

<p><br><strong>Whole steps and half steps</strong><br>
The smallest interval that exists in Western (I don&#8217;t mean country and western) music is the half step. In the first
audio example in the previous section, each note was a half step above the previous one. On certain instruments, it&#8217;s
possible to play pitches that are in between the 12 pitches we are used to hearing. In this case, there are intervals
smaller than a half step. For our purposes, we won&#8217;t concern ourselves with hearing pitches that are in between the 12
we know. If you decide later on that you want to develop your ear for intonation or microtones (as the in between
pitches are called), you can find other methods and tools to practice that. In this program, all notes are in tune.</p>

<p>The next smallest interval is a whole step. Two half steps together make a whole step. In the next audio example,
you&#8217;ll hear two notes played that are a half step apart, followed by two notes that are a whole step apart. Listen to
it several times until you can hear the difference between half steps and whole steps. It&#8217;s also a worthwhile exercise
to play half steps and whole steps all over the range of your own instrument so you really learn the sound of them.</p>

<h2 id="themajorscaleandkey">The major scale and key</h2>

<p>This is what a major scale sounds like:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="c-major-scale-example">
  <source src="audio/c_major_scale.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio></center>

<p>A major scale is just a pattern of whole steps and half steps. Every major scale is built from the same pattern,
although they start on different pitches. Given 12 different pitches, there are 12 different major
scales.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>
Each major scale is made of 7 different notes. To make it easy to talk about and analyze music, we can assign each note
a different number. These are called <strong>scale degrees</strong>. We start with 1 and count up to 7. When we reach 7, we can
go back to 1, this time a higher version of the first 1, and keep counting from there. Listen again to the audio example
above and say the scale degree of each note: &#8220;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1&#8221;. As always, it&#8217;s also a great exercise to do that on
your own instrument to familiarize yourself with the sound and the names of the notes.</p>

<p>When a piece of music is composed primarily using the notes and chords from a major scale, we say that the piece of
music is in a major key. A key is what sounds like the resolution point or &#8220;home base&#8221; of a piece of music. You could
also think of it as providing a context for the notes you hear in a piece of music. Notes that are in the key have a
particular sound and notes that are outside the key have a different sound. We call notes that are within the key
<strong>diatonic</strong> and notes that are outside of the key <strong>non-diatonic</strong> or <strong>chromatic</strong>. Non-diatonic notes sound a little
out of place compared to diatonic ones.</p>

<h2 id="minorkeysandnon-diatonicnotes">Minor keys and non-diatonic notes</h2>

<p>In addition to the major scale and key, there&#8217;s a minor scale and
key.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> Here&#8217;s what a minor scale sounds like:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="c-minor-scale-example">
  <source src="audio/c_minor_scale.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio></center>

<p>Unfortunately, assigning scale degrees to a minor scale isn&#8217;t as easy as it was with the major scale. The reason for
this is that most things in music theory are named relative to the major scale. Since the first two notes of the minor
scale are the same as the first two notes of the major scale, they get the same scale degrees - 1 and 2. But if you
listen to the audio example again, you&#8217;ll hear that the third note is different than the major scale. We need to name
it something else; this requires the use of sharps and flats.</p>

<p><br><strong>Sharps and flats</strong><br>
Sharps and flats let us refer to notes that are a half step above or below another note. <strong>Sharp</strong> means half step
above, and <strong>flat</strong> means half step below. Let&#8217;s say for example that we have a note called Fred. If we wanted to
refer to a note a half step above Fred, we could call it &#8220;Fred sharp.&#8221; We could call the note a half step below, &#8220;Fred
flat.&#8221; Sharps and flats have shorthand symbols to make writing and reading them easier. Sharp is written as &#x266f;
and flat is written as &#x266d;.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to name the rest of the notes in the minor scale. The third note of the minor scale is a half step
lower than the third note of the major scale, so we call it &#x266d;3. In the tables below, you can see the rest of the
scale degrees for major and minor scales, including the in-between non-diatonic notes.</p>

<h2 id="solfxe8gevsscaledegrees">Solf&#xe8;ge vs scale degrees</h2>

<p>In addition to scale degrees, there is another way to name the notes in a key. It&#8217;s called solfege, with a fancy accent
over the first &#8216;e&#8217; like this: solf&#xe8;ge. To save me from having to remember how to type the accent, I&#8217;ll just call
it solfege from here on out. Solfege uses pronounceable syllables to name the notes instead of numbers. It&#8217;s very
likely that you&#8217;ve already heard solfege syllables. The song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dpGmAc3kMk">&#8220;Do Re Mi Fa&#8221;</a> from the &#8220;Sound of Music&#8221; is a famous example.</p>

<p>Before explaining what the syllables are and how they relate to the scale degrees we already know, let&#8217;s take a moment
to answer a question you might have - &#8220;Why on Earth are there TWO different ways to name the notes in a major scale?
Surely one way must be better than the other and we should just use that one.&#8221; The main benefit of solfege is that the
note names are are easy to sing and each is only one syllable long (not like &#8220;seven&#8221; or &#8220;flat three&#8221;). If you imagine
Julie Andrews singing that song using scale degrees rather than solfege, it wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as memorable.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this ear training method, you can decide whether you prefer scale degrees or solfege to name
the notes, and just use that. There&#8217;s an option for each one in the program. Here&#8217;s how the solfege syllables
relate to the notes in a major scale:</p>

<p>Now for the pronunciation - &#8220;do&#8221; is pronounced like &#8220;dough&#8221;, &#8220;re&#8221; is pronounced like &#8220;ray&#8221; (a drop of golden sun), and
&#8220;mi&#8221; and &#8220;ti&#8221; sound like &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;tea&#8221; respectively. This covers the diatonic notes in the major scale. What about
the in between notes? In solfege, when a note is flatted, you take the first letter of the note and add &#8220;e&#8221; (sounds
like &#8220;ay&#8221;) as the vowel after it. For example, &#x266d;3 is &#8220;me&#8221; (&#8220;may&#8221;) and &#x266d;6 is &#8220;le&#8221; (&#8220;lay&#8221;). We need to
make an exception for &#x266d;2 and we call it &#8220;ra&#8221;, as in &#8220;Sun Ra.&#8221; To alter the syllables for sharp notes, we take
the first letter of the syllable and change the vowel sound to &#8220;i&#8221; (&#8220;ee&#8221;). For example, &#x266f;4 becomes &#8220;fi&#8221; and
&#x266f;6 becomes &#8220;li.&#8221; Therefore, just as &#x266f;2 is the same note as &#x266d;3, &#8220;ri&#8221; is the same note as &#8220;me.&#8221;
They&#8217;re enharmonic.</p>

<p>Here are the syllables formatted as diatonic and non-diatonic in both major and minor keys. Just like we did with
scale degrees, we&#8217;ll only use the flat names for chromatic notes, to make it look a little cleaner and because
our goal here isn&#8217;t to be pedantic, but to have a working knowledge of the basics. Of course, if you want to
have a solid grasp of solfege, you should work on also using the enharmonic names.</p>

<h1 id="howthemethodworks">How the method works</h1>

<h2 id="thecadence">The cadence</h2>

<p>A cadence is a sequence of chords that often occurs at the end of a phrase or section in a piece of music. When it is
used to conclude a piece of music, it usually has a sound of finality that clearly defines the key of the composition.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> Here&#8217;s an example
of a major cadence. The first and last chords played are the tonic chord (or &#8220;home base&#8221;) of the key:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="major-cadence-example">
  <source src="audio/major_cadence_example.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

<p>And this is a cadence in a minor key:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="minor-cadence-example">
  <source src="audio/minor_cadence_example.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

<p>In this method of ear training, we&#8217;ll play a sequence consisting of four chords to establish the sound of the key. Then
we&#8217;ll play one or more random notes and learn to identify the sound of each note in that particular key.</p>

<h2 id="identifyingthenotes">Identifying the notes</h2>

<p>At first, trying to identify a note by listening for its function in a key is a daunting task. How can you hear a
cadence, then a note, and then just pluck out its name from thin air? As with everything else, we start simply and
progress in small increments. The example below plays a cadence, and then plays Do in the key:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="cadence-and-do-example">
  <source src="audio/cadence_and_do.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>
</center>

<p>Play it several times and pay close attention to the way Do sounds. To me it sounds stable and resolved, even a little
plain and uninteresting. What does it sound like to you? All the other notes sound less stable than Do. Often, it
feels like your ear wants to hear them resolve to Do. Listen to this next example, which plays the cadence followed by
the note Re:</p>

<center>
<audio controls id="cadence-and-re-example">
  <source src="audio/cadence_and_re.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <i>Your browser doesn't support this audio</i>
</audio>

<p>To me, Re sounds like it has a healthy desire to move down a whole step to Do. While it doesn&#8217;t sound totally unstable
or dissonant, there is a bit of tension. Go back and play the previous two samples several times and pay close
attention to the difference in the way Do and Re sound. Soon you will hear the difference between them as clearly as
you can see the difference between orange and purple.</p>

<h2 id="babysteps">Baby steps</h2>

<p>Now that you can identify Do and Re, it&#8217;s time to start adding other notes. That is the real benefit of using this
program to practice this method of ear training. You can customize which notes the program will choose from to play
after the cadence, allowing you to progress in small easy increments or isolate notes that you have trouble with.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that some notes have two different names, there are actually 15 different major scales when writing out the scales on paper. But 3 of those scales are redundant and since we&#8217;re not concerned with naming actual pitches here, we will just take it as a fact that there are 12 different major scales, one starting on each of the 12 pitches. <a href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4">
<p>There are actually 3 different minor scales, and more scales still that have a certain amount of &#8220;minorness&#8221; to their sound.
